Title: Confidence Intervals and Sample Size Calculations for the Ratio of Parameters of Expinentially Distributed, Right Censored Data
Version: 0.4.1
Author: Johann Mattutat
Maintainer: Johann Mattutat <johann.mattutat@student.uni-luebeck.de>
Description: This package implements various confidence intervals for the ratio of parameters of exponentially distributed (right censored) survival data.
    Supported are parametric (Wald, Score (2*), Gradient) statistics and computational (coxph, survreg) confidence intervals.
    Furthermore, sample size calculations based on theese parametric approaches and based on the Schoenfeld formula are implemented.
    The implemented formulas are derived in the Author's master thesis.
